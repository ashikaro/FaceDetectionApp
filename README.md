# FaceDetectionApp

I have chosen BlurMyFace as the application.
When the app loads, I display a picture chosen from the drawable folder.These are the features I have implemented:
1. On load, it displays the original image in the app.
2. There are 3 buttons
1. BLUR MY FACE which blurs the face of the person and displays whether the face is smiling or not based on a threshold defined in the code
2. UNBLUR which restores the face back to its original.
3. DETECT_FACE which draws circles on all the landmarks of
the face.
3. Implemented the feature which blurs the face when the phone is
shaken using accelerometer. It takes couple of seconds after the movement of the co-ordinates in the emulator.
